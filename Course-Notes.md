## CHAPTER 1-2 READING NOTES

### CHAPTER 1:
- When we obtain data it is unstructured most of the time and its our job as data scientist to structure that data and draw useful information from it.
- Python is a scrypting language that can be used to quickly write small programs or scripts that automate different tasks.
- In the last 10 years python has become one of the most important languages for data science, machine learning, and general software development.
*Drawbacks to Python*
- As Python is an interpreted programming language, in general most Python code will run substantially slower than code written in a compiled language like Java or C++.
- Python can be a challenging language for building highly concurrent, multithreaded applications, particularly applications with many CPU-bound threads.
*Essential Python Libraries*
- **Numpy(Numerical Python)** provides the data structures, algorithms, and library glue needed for most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python.
- For numerical data, NumPy arrays are more efficient for storing and manipulating data than the other built in Python data structures.
- Libraries written in a lower level language, such as C or Fortran, can operate on the data stored in a NumPy array without copying data into some other memory representation.
- **Pandas** provides high level data structures and functions designed to make working with structured or tabular data fast, easy, and expressive.
- Its primary objects include DataFrame, a tabular, column oriented data structure with both row and column labels, and the Series, a one dimensional labeled array object.
- **matplotlib** is the most popular Python library for producing plots and other two dimensional data visualizations.
- **scipy** is a collection of packages addressing a number of different standard problem domains in scientific computing.
- **scikit-learn** is the general purpose machine learning toolkit for Python Programmers. It includes submodules like...
  - Classification
  - Clustering 
  - Dimensionality reduction
  - Model Selection
  - Preprocessing 
- **statsmodel** is a statistical analysis package that implements a number of regres‚Äê sion analysis models popular in the R programming language. 
- It contains algorithms for classical statistics and econometrics. It also includes submodules like...
  - Analysis of Variance 
  - Regression Models
  - Time Series Analysis
  - Nonparametric Methods
  - Visualizations of statistical model results
- **Import COnventions** 
  - import numpy as np
  - import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  - import pandas as pd
  - import seaborn as sns
  - import statsmodels as sm
